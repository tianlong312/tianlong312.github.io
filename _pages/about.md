I graduated from Purdue University and Stanford University with a focus in structural engineering. Right now, I am a software engineer working with AI models on embedded devices. Previsouly, I have been working on SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and traditional computer vision.

In my spare time, I am a bass player and I love to take photos.
